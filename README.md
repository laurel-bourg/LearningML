# LearningML
Follow my progress as I self-study machine learning!

The fields of astronomy, astrophysics, and planetary science involve various froms of characterization and interpretation of data. The further development of machine learning will enable scientists to spend less time sorting spectral data and images and more time doing science with the results. I am making my progress public incase any person wants to follow along as an astrophysics student delves into the world of ML.
